# Dependencies (SBOM)

Full transitive dependency graph for `example-project` 19, generated from [bom.json](bom.json)[1] (CycloneDX 1.6) at build time. Same SBOM source as the SPDX-grouped [licenses.html](licenses.html)[2] and the curated [built-with.html](built-with.html)[3] — three views of the same data.
